## How to write a good Write-up

### Introduciton
I've participated to lot of CTFs and every time one ends I always read **good, bad and "shitty" Write-up.**

When you are writing a Write-up, keep in mind that you are not writing it for Fame and Glory (maybe also for this),
but *you should write it for other users that want to learn and explore new way to think and most important,*  
***you should write it for yourself!!*** .  

Sometimes I find challenges in CTF that I've already completed some time ago,
or at work I see problems that I've already solved during a CTF and going back reading those Write-up made me cringe every time.  

So **I think it will be good to write some guidelines for us (and you!) to follow when writing write-up.**

### Step 0 - Required Information
If you are writing a Write-up for a CTF there are some information that you ***NEED*** to include.
This information are:

- **CTF name**
- **Challenge name**
- **Challenge description**
- **Challenge category** => so users know the chall's field
- **Challenge points** => so users know the chall's difficulty
- *CTF Year and Date* **[OPTIONAL]** => so users know if it's outdated

### Step 1 - Content
**When writing your content don't be too greedy.**  
I've seen some Write-up made up of a to-do list, some made of just Python/JS code with no comment what-so-ever.

You have to explain the *exact sequence of thoughts* you have done to go from A to B.  
"I have `2`, I know that `2 + 2 = flag` so I made this script that does `2 + 2` and I got the `flag`"   
Just don't post your code without a description or some comments please.  


**When writing your content don't be too verbose.**  
I mean, *you can*, but **(at the top) insert an abstract/summary as a** ***TL;DR*** **(at least 50 words)**

Don't forget that if you include too much useless details you *will result boring*.  
So you can use some memes pic or you can write some jokes to keep the readers glued to the screen.  

### Step 2 - Extra Points

You get *GOLDEN SHINING* Extra points if:

- You use **bold**, *italic* or ***both*** to enhance the Content's key-point.
- You add **some screenshot**.
- You **correctly format** small code snippet, path, strings, etc.
- Your writeup is **reproducible** (You must attach the challenge source-code, sometimes this can't be done).
- Your writeup is **multilanguage** (***English is a priority. At least for TL;DRs***).
