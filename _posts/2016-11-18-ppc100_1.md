## PPC 100_1
PPC - 100 Points

We received messages with dates of creation. Our channel was unsafe and along with correct messages we received ones with wrong timestamps - you need to filter them.

A tar.gz file is given.

### Writeup
We started by looking inside some files too see if the content could help us

{% highlight bash %}
cat Wednesday_9_May_2152.txt
# 9bcf36ca6ef3c7af3137f9661c2b4b09
{% endhighlight %}

This is obviously an MD5 hash so we tried to do `md5($filename)` but returned nothing useful.

We noticed that some dates where in the future so we searched for a date in November 2016 hoping to find today (17-11-2016)

{% highlight bash %}
ls | grep November_2016
# Saturday_3_November_2016.txt
# Thursday_12_November_2016.txt
# Tuesday_16_November_2016.txt
{% endhighlight %}

No luck, but wait! **Yesterday was Wednesday not Tuesday_16_November_2016.txt**

Now that we knew where was the error, we made a script to count the wrong filename
{% highlight bash %}
python wrong_day.py
# 7936
{% endhighlight %}

What??? **7937-7936=1** So there is only one legit filename! Let's find it

{% highlight python %}
#!/usr/bin python

import os
from datetime import datetime

correct_days = []

for m in os.listdir("./messages"):
	day = m.split('_')[0]
	date = datetime.strptime(m, '%A_%d_%B_%Y.txt')
	realday = date.strftime('%A')
	#print realday,day,m
	if day == realday:
		correct_days.append(m)

if len(correct_days) == 1:
	with open(os.path.join("./messages",correct_days[0]), 'r') as fday:
		cont = fday.read()
		print cont
