## Crypto 101

**This is a beginner guide, not an Academic paper**  
**This Cheatsheet will be updated regularly**

When you are trying to solve a Crypto Challenge for a CTF, first of all, you need to detect which [Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher) is used.  
For example if it's a [Symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_key_algorithm) or [Asymmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_key_algorithm) cipher, a [Classic cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_cipher) or if it's just an [Hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function).

*Keep in mind that CTFs are meant to be broken so think before implementing a bruteforce over an AES-128 key.  
Bruteforce may be present but only over a limited key-space*

**NOTE: Most of the time the encrypted message is the flag, and most of the time the flag is in a known format like `ctfname{data}` so this will leak part of the plaintext. Be smart**

### Misc
If your ciphertext has lots of numbers and `@\>%`, don't worry it's **rot47**  
If your ciphertext has only uppercase letters and numbers test it as **base32**
If your ciphertext has alphanumeric chars and ends with `=` or `==` it's **base64**
It might be that they used their own alphabet for the base64. [Check this page](https://www.malwaretracker.com/decoder_base64.php) to better understand this.
Always test for **rot13** if the challenge gives few points

### Hash
There are some tool to detect the hash type (if it's not known), but a search on [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hash+0800fc577294c34e0b28ad2839435945) with the prefix `hash` will also do the trick.  
If organizers are using a custom hashing algo you won't find it, but I hope you will find out it's custom (and broken).

Now that you know what hashing algo it is, most of the time you will need to find a sort of collision.

If it's a (not-full) prefix/postfix/pattern collision, you can solve it by **bruteforce**.  
Sometimes this falls under the term PoW (Proof-of-Work).  

e.g. `sha1('SaltyToast'+str) start with '00000'`  
See [this python script]({{ site.url }}/assets/crypto_hash_pow.py) that solve the example above

#### Reusable hash collision on Merkle-Damgård based hash function

Merkle-Damgård based hash functions (MD5, SHA1, SHA2) uses this construction:
![Merkle-Damgård](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Merkle-Damgard_hash_big.svg/800px-Merkle-Damgard_hash_big.svg.png){: .center-image .half-image }

**Basic Property of Merkle-Damgård hash functions:**  
Let `a` and `a’` be strings with `length(a) = length(a’)` = multiple of input block length,  
Let `H0` be the hash function without length padding  
Let `||` be the concatenation function  
`H0(a)=H0(a’)` implies `H(a||b)=H(a’||b)` for an arbitrary string `b`  
Then the pair `a`/`a’` is a [reusable hash collision](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/documents/Illies_NIST_05.pdf)

In this case if there is a [public known existing collision]({{ site.url }}/assets/md5_collision.txt), you can **append** the same message to get another collision.

e.g. With this Python script
{% highlight python %}
import md5
m = md5.new()
m1 = '0e306561559aa787d00bc6f70bbdfe3404cf03659e704f8534c00ffb659c4c8740cc942feb2da115a3f4155cbb8607497386656d7d1f34a42059d78f5a8dd1ef'.decode('hex')
m2 = '0e306561559aa787d00bc6f70bbdfe3404cf03659e744f8534c00ffb659c4c8740cc942feb2da115a3f415dcbb8607497386656d7d1f34a42059d78f5a8dd1ef'.decode('hex')
a = 'Hello World'
mm1 = md5.new()
mm2 = md5.new()
mm1.update(m1)
mm2.update(m2)
assert(mm1.digest() == mm2.digest())
mm1.update(a)
mm2.update(a)
assert(mm1.digest() == mm2.digest())
{% endhighlight %}

#### MD5

Some tools for generating MD5 [collision](http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/) ([hashclash](https://marc-stevens.nl/p/hashclash/), [fastcoll](https://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/), [SAPHIR-Livrables](http://www.crypto-hash.fr/modules/wfdownloads/singlefile.php?cid=13&lid=14)) or [SingleBlock collision (very HOT)](https://marc-stevens.nl/research/md5-1block-collision/).

### Classic cipher

#### Caesar ciper
On [Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) you can try a *[CiphertextOnly Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext-only_attack) (COA) aka Known Ciphertext Attack (KCA)* by analizing the statistics of each character
I've made a [website](https://thez3ro.github.io/coincidence-index/) that does this automatically by comparing the IC of each letter with ones from
Italian and English dictionary.

**This will only works if your alphabet is limited to**: `A-Z` or `a-z`

Also Caesar can be broken with a *[Known-plaintext attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Known-plaintext_attack) (KPA)*.  
If some messages are encrypted with the same key, you can recover the key from a Plaintext-Ciphertext pair and decrypt the other messages.
(or part of messages).

e.g. have the following ciphertext: `dahhksknhzwoaynapodkqhznaiwejoaynap`, we know that the crib (plaintext) starts with `helloworld`.  
We can see that shifting by `4` return `dahhksknhz`, the starting ciphertext. So now we know that the key is shift by `4` and we can decrypt all the message. (Try it yourself ;)

Another demo is available here in [this SECCON2016](https://github.com/tothi/ctfs/tree/master/seccon-quals-ctf-2016/randomware) challenge

In a *[Chosen-plaintext Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen-plaintext_attack) (CPA)* scenario, where you can input a plaintext in a Caesar encryption oracle, remember that shifting `A` by `C` will result in `C`, so a plaintext made of `A`'s will expose the Key as ciphertext.  
This also works as a *[Chosen-ciphertext Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen-ciphertext_attack) (CCA)*
Like in this [HackThatKiwi2015 CTF](https://pequalsnp-team.github.io/writeups/vigenere1) challenge

#### Vigenere ciper
[Vigenere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher) is done by repeating Caesar for each letter in the plaintext with a different shift according to the key.
You can try a *COA* once you have guessed the keylenght (with Kasisky).  
Or You can try a *KPA* or *CPA/CCA* like in Caesar.

Also sometimes you will need to bruteforce a partial key like in [this SECCON2016]({{ site.url }}/assets/crypto_vigenere.py) challenge

### Symmetric

#### XOR
See Caesar/Vigenere section

The [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher) is based on the Exclusive disjunction. (returns `1` only if inputs are different)  
So note this rules:  
`A ^ 0 = A`  
`A ^ A = 0`  
`(A ^ B) ^ A = B`

XORing a Plaintext with a Key will output a Ciphertext that XORed again with the Plaintext will return the Key.
