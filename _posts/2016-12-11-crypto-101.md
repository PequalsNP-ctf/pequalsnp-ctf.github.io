## Crypto 101

**This is a beginner guide, it's not an Academic paper**  
**This Cheatsheet will be updated regularely**

When you are trying to solve a Crypto Challenge for a CTF, first of all, you need to detect what [Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher) is used.  
For example if it's a [Symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_key_algorithm) or [Asymmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_key_algorithm) cipher a [Classic cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_cipher) or if it's just an [Hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function).

*Keep in mind that CTF are created to be broken so think before implementing a bruteforce over an AES-128 key.  
Bruteforce may be present but only over a limited key-space*

### Hash
There are some tool to detect the hash type (if it's not known), but a search on [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hash+0800fc577294c34e0b28ad2839435945) with the prefix `hash` will also do the trick.  
If organizers are using a custom hashing algo you won't find it, but I hope you will find out it's custom (and broken).

Now that you know what hashing algo it is, most of the time you will need to find a sort of collision.

It will never be a full-collision (unless the hash algo is custom and deeply broken :P) but a prefix/postfix/pattern collission, sometimes this falls under the term PoW (Proof-of-Work).  
This can be solved by **bruteforce**.

ex. `sha1(prefix+str) start with '00000'`  
See [this python script]({{ site.url }}/assets/crypto_hash_pow.py) that solve the example above

### Classic cipher

#### Caesar ciper
On [Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) you can try a *[CiphertextOnly Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext-only_attack) (COA) aka Known Ciphertext Attack (KCA)* by analizing the statistics of each character
I've made a [website](https://thez3ro.github.io/coincidence-index/) that does this automatically by comparing the IC of each letter with ones from
Italian and English dictionary.

**This will only works if your alphabet is limited to**: `A-Z` or `a-z`

Also Caesar can be broken with a *[Known-plaintext attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Known-plaintext_attack) (KPA)*.  
If some messages are encrypted with the same key, you can recover the key from a Plaintext-Ciphertext pair and decrypt the other messages.
(or part of messages).

ex. have the following ciphertext: `dahhksknhzwoaynapodkqhznaiwejoaynap`, we know that the crib (plaintext) starts with `helloworld`.  
We can see that shifting by `4` return `dahhksknhz`, the starting ciphertext. So now we know that the key is shift by `4` and we can decrypt all the message. (Try it yourself ;)

Another demo is available here in [this SECCON2016](https://github.com/tothi/ctfs/tree/master/seccon-quals-ctf-2016/randomware) challenge

In a *[Chosen-plaintext Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen-plaintext_attack) (CPA)* scenario, where you can input a plaintext in a Caesar encryption oracle, remember that shifting `A` by `C` will result in `C`, so a plaintext made of `A`'s will expose the Key as ciphertext.  
This also works as a *[Chosen-ciphertext Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen-ciphertext_attack) (CCA)*
Like in this [HackThatKiwi2015 CTF](https://pequalsnp-team.github.io/writeups/vigenere1) challenge

#### Vigenere ciper
[Vigenere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher) is done by repeating Caesar for each letter in the plaintext with a different shift according to the key.
You can try a *COA* once you have guessed the keylenght (with Kasisky).  
Or You can try a *KPA* or *CPA/CCA* like in Caesar.

Also sometimes you will need to bruteforce a partial key like in [this SECCON2016]({{ site.url }}/assets/crypto_vigenere.py) challenge

### Symmetric

#### XOR
See Caesar/Vigenere section

#### Feistel
A reverse-crypto [SECCCON2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20161212133211/http://van.prooyen.com/reversing/cryptography/2016/12/11/Lost-Decryption-Writeup.html) challenge for [Feistel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feistel_cipher)

#### AES EBC


#### AES CBC


### Asymmetric

####  RSA

####  Diffie-Hellman
