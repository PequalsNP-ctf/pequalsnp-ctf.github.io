## Crypto 101

When you are trying to solve a Crypto Challenge for a CTF, first of all, you need to detect what [Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher) is used.  
For example if it's a [Symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_key_algorithm) or [Asymmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_key_algorithm) cipher a [Classic cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_cipher) or if it's just an [Hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function).

### Hash
There are some tool to detect the hash type (if it's not known), but a search on [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hash+0800fc577294c34e0b28ad2839435945) with the prefix `hash` will also do the trick.  
If organizers are using a custom hashing algo you won't find it, but I hope you will find out it's custom (and broken).

Now that you know what hashing algo it is, most of the time you will need to find a sort of collision.

It will never be a full-collision (unless the hash algo is custom and deeply broken :P) but a prefix/postfix/pattern collission, sometimes this falls under the term PoW (Proof-of-Work).  
This can be solved by **bruteforce**.

ex. `sha1(prefix+str) start with '00000'`  
See [this python script]({{ site.url }}/assets/crypto_hash_pow.py) that solve the example above
