## Vigenere 1 / 2
Crypto - 50/80 Points

Vigenere is a classic cryptographic cipher. It is very simple, yet not that easy to break. Unless you break Vigenere on your own, you can't call yourself a cryptanalyst. Start with the simplest mode, Chosen Plaintext Attack:

So you got crypto skills, right? Try it again on Known Plaintext Mode:

### Writeup
In Vigenere 1 we had a Chosen Plaintext, where you give a plain text input and the webpage return the ciphertext.
The solution is very simple. In the default Vigenere alphabet, "A" is the Reflecting character so a plaintext of
"AAAAAAAAAA" returns the key as ciphertext.

The key was "KIWIKI", it was repeated but that's how Vigenere so you take the shortest non-repeating key.

In Vigenere 2 we had a Known Plaintext, where you know both plaintext and it's ciphertext.
You can do this by hands but I made a simple script that can do this for you.

      baseAlphabet = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z')
      plainText = raw_input("Please enter the plain text\n")
      cypherText = raw_input("Please enter the cypher text\n")
      key=[]
      i=0
      for plainTextChar in plainText:
        pkey = baseAlphabet.index(plainTextChar.lower())
        ckey = baseAlphabet.index(cypherText[i].lower())
        key.append(baseAlphabet[ckey-pkey])
        i=i+1
      print ''.join(key)

The key was "XEROX"
