## Compiling/Patching SSLDump for decrypting TLS1.1/1.2


Wireshark is a wonderfull tool, but there are some bug with the SSL/TLS packet decryption.<br/>
A simple alternative is SSLDump, a 2003 tool that is not maintained anymore.<br/>
A guy named "David Holmes" in 2011 added a patch for decrypting TLS1.1/1.2 packet in SSLDump,<br/>
but this patch is not in the last version of SSLDump in the major distro repository (lastest is 0.9b3).<br/>

For adding this patch you need to download the

 - [ssldump source](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ssldump/files/ssldump/0.9b3/)
 - [ssldump patch #8](http://sourceforge.net/p/ssldump/patches/8/)

Make sure you have the pcap and OpenSSL library installed, on Debian-based system

      sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev libssl-dev

Now `cd` inside the ssldump source folder and copy the patch file here.<br/>
Patch the source with the `patch` command (pre-Installed on most POSIX systems)

      patch -p1 < ssldump.tls12-appdata-decrypt.patch

Compile the new ssldump source

      ./configure
      make
      sudo make install

Now you are ready to go with a fresh

      ssldump -d -r ./packets.pcap -k ./server_key.pem host 127.0.0.1
