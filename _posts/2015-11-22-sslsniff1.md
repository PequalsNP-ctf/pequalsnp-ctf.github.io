## SSL Sniff 1
Forensics - 50 Points

We received a network capture file of an HTTPS request that was MITMd. Try to find the culprit.

### Writeup
The file is a normal PCAP file, I've opened it with Wireshark and searched for some useful information
then I realized that the MITM ccould be done with a fake Certificate and here is the flag

![SSL]({{ site.url }}/assets/sslsniff.png){: .center-image }

Flag: Key-Is-dUs1mKl4
