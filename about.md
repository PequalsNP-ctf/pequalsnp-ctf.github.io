We're a group of students, computer security enthusiasts and [CTF](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) players from the [University of Milan](https://di.unimi.it/).

The team was created in August 2015 in order to deepen knowledge on various InfoSec areas, play CTF and participate in national / international events.

The team's name comes from the [P versus NP problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem) and the [Computational complexity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory).

 ~ PequalsNP.
