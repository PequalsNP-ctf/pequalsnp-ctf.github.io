<p>
Team of 2 members (thezero and phosphore), duration of 30 hours, we have solved 11/61 challenges<br/>
and almost solved other 4 challenges :( .<br/>
Final score: 1600 points, Final Rank: 74/234 amongs all Teams.<br/><br/>
We enjoyed this CTF (although some Challenge were almost impossible to solve, and the website was really slow and buggy).<br/><br/>
As always, we pubblish only the most notable writeups.

<ul class="posts">
  {% for post in site.tags[page.cat] %}
